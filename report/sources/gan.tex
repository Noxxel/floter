\chapter{Image Generation with GANs}
    In this chapter we elaborate on the different methods we employed to produce images from the extracted features. An arbitrary dataset of images can be used here, we went with \citetitle{102flower}~\cite{102flower}, a dataset of 102 different types of flowers containing slightly over 8000 images with a resolution of at least 500x500.
