\chapter{Conclusion}
    We reached our base goal of generating visualizations which visibly correlate to the music when played alongside.
    \TODO{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item maybe mimic the latent vector distribution instead of using pretrained models during training of GANs
            \item maybe should mention proGANs? slowly increasing the resolution seems smart
            \item train models where the discriminator is more complex than generator
        \end{itemize}

    \section{Visualizing your own music}
    If the reader of this report would like to generate a visualization of a mp3-file of his likings, he can clone the project repository from our github page and download one of our pretrained state dictionaries from \TODO{INSERT LINK}. After inserting the states into the right folder, one can place their
