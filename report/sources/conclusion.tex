\chapter{Conclusion}
    We reached our base goal of generating visualizations which visibly correlate to the music when played alongside.
    We achieved our best results with the generator which was trained on the raw mel spectrogram vectors.
    \TODO{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item maybe mimic the latent vector distribution instead of using pretrained models during training of GANs
            \item maybe should mention proGANs? slowly increasing the resolution seems smart
            \item train models where the discriminator is more complex than generator
        \end{itemize}
    }
    \TODO{
        This chapter will contain the following
        \begin{itemize}
            \item too high res for fast feedback during training. epochs take forever.
            \item speculate about genres available in FMA (??? what did i mean with this)
        \end{itemize}
        List of methods that delviered results of sufficient quality:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item raw mels + dcgan
            \item ae + infogan (?)
            \item more?
        \end{itemize}
    }
