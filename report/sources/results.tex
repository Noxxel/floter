    \section{Generating videos}
        
        Theoretically we can generate videos with each possible combination of extracted features and trained generators.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item how did we generate images from the trained nets?
            \item maybe also discuss/display intermediate results? (genre classification, autoencoder, single generated images)
        \end{itemize}

    \section{Ensuring smooth transitions}
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item smoothing?
            \item what did we do to smoothen the video?
            \item smoothing --> talk about the movement through feature space when producing a video from song
        \end{itemize}

    \section{Results}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item display the stuff that was on the poster? in an attempt to put a video on paper
        \end{itemize}
