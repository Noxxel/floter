\chapter{Results}\label{ch:results}
    \TODO{
        This chapter will contain the following
        \begin{itemize}
            \item how did we generate images from the trained nets?
            \item smoothing?
            \item what did we do to smoothen the video?
            \item too high res for fast feedback during training. epochs take forever.
            \item display the stuff that was on the poster? in an attempt to put a video on paper
            \item talk about the movement through feature space when producing a video from song
            \item speculate about genres available in FMA (??? what did i mean with this)
            \item maybe also discuss intermediate results? (genre classification, autoencoder, single generated images)
        \end{itemize}
        \vspace{2cm}
        List of methods that delviered results of sufficient quality:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item raw mels + dcgan
            \item ae + infogan (?)
            \item more?
        \end{itemize}
