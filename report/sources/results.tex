\chapter{Results}\label{ch:results}
    \TODO{
        This chapter will contain the following
        \begin{itemize}
            \item how did we generate images from the trained nets?
            \item what did we do to smoothen the video?
            \item too high res for fast feedback during training
            \item maybe should mention proGANs? slowly increasing the resolution seems smart
            \item display the stuff that was on the poster? in an attempt to put a video on paper
            \item talk about the movement through feature space when producing a video from song
            \item speculate about genres available in FMA
            \item maybe also discuss intermediate results? (genre classification, autoencoder, single generated images)
        \end{itemize}
